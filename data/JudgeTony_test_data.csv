Sometimes they rename American movies to fit for the local market. Like Taken with Liam Neeson in Albania, it was called Normal Business Guy Does Honest Business until American Asshole intervenes Schindler's List in Germany. It was called Shy. So Close. But my favorite movies are Denzel Washington movies. He makes killing look so easy. He's just a lazy, fat old guy. You are at home eating chips. You're like, yeah, I got it like that. Every Denzel movie is him at a diner trying to finish a meal, but then a hooker gets in trouble. Every Denzel movie's, just him at a diner kill us. 26 people takes down a whole syndicate. It's a hot hooker though. You gotta save a hot hooker. Okay. This is an act out of Denzel Washington trying to finish a meal. But then the hooker who gets in trouble is a fat cow.

I was doing Tinder for a while, and you know a lot of comics they talk about Tinder, it's like infamously the worst dating app ya know. But the craziest thing to me about Tinder, when I was doing that and creating my profile, Tinder makes you pick a bunch of hobbies and interests that show up on your profile. You cannot finish creating your profile without picking hobbies and interests, so Tinder gives you a big list of hobbies to pick from. I thought this was interesting, you know you can pick Black Lives Matter as a hobby. That's a hobby? I support BLM, ya know, but that's not a hobby to me, that's just something that is. Like food or something, I'm like yes. Black people, feel acknowledged, exist... If you don't know what a hobby is, a hobby is like something you can do after work, like you can squeeze in with the free time, like playing the drums or something. And you wanna do that with the lives of black people? That's your hobby?
