They can start fresh and clean 20 miles the fuck away from me. Now, I understand there's a lot of veterans that are homeless, and I want to have a soft spot for them but it's hard for me to, because we taught them how to make money.

Now personally, I haven't put my dick in the diarrhea dungeon because when I was younger I concocted this irrational fear that when I pulled out I'd have a piece of shit corn stuck in my pee hole.

That's not why we broke up though. It was actually because he's a whore bisexual I can deal with. But by loyal, absolutely not. Then I found out my boyfriend's best friend's girlfriend, she, she confessed to me that they had had a threesome, which is crazy. Like they tied her up naked in the bed. She thought she was gonna get some kinky, good fun, but they actually just forgot she was there and went out. Just, you know, right next to her. Which to me sounds a lot less like a threesome and more like a coming out party that took a hostage. It actually took 'em two years to admit that all of those things were true too.

I'm not gonna lie, it's just a buoy sitting in the middle of the lake flaccid just chilling. You know, because that's what I do.

And I was like, nah, I'm here for the festival. I love Blake Sheldon. I love Kenny Chesney. And he was like, nigga, stop lying. I got an extra vest in my car. And I was like, no, I'm here for the festival. And I showed him my ID And I showed him my badge and he looked at my ID and he looked at my badge and he looked at me and he looked at my Tasha, you gonna want to hear this? So Tasha came over, I met Tasha, she did the same thing. Jamal, I met everybody one by one. I made all 37 black people. Like I'm a black Noah's arc. They kept calling me the Dave Walker. They said I was Blade And it, it was a great country music festival, man. 'cause all the black people that was working the event kept giving me free drinks. But they also had reentry. They stopped doing it. They had reentry into the festival. So we just go to the car and like parking lot pimp drink beers. And the only reason, the reason why we knew it was time to go drink beers is 'cause my best friend Jesse, who was a redneck Filipino but raised black 'cause she was my best friend. Her older sister Jackie had just had a kid. And she would look us in the face and she would be like, I need to get outta here. My tits about to pop. I gotta go pump. So we would go back to the car and she's chugging beers. We're all drinking beers and she's pumping. But she pumped more than like a regular, like a white woman could never pump as much milk as it takes to make a redneck Filipino that's raised black. Like my nephew Maxwell today, he's 10 years old. He's taller than me. So she's pumping a lot And I'm looking at her titty milk. And I wanted to taste something, but I ain't know how to ask. And then God, God got my back so much he confused. My friend Derrick, my friend Derek saw me looking at the breast milk and he was like, yo, I bet you a hundred dollars you won't drink Jackie's breast milk, nigga. I was already thinking about it. I I, she got a husband. I don't know how you ask somebody like, are y'all a couple? How do you get if you have breast milk? I gotta be like, Hey, excuse me brother. This breakfast milk, you ain't even bring it to your kids. It got alcohol in it. Can I, can I sip some before you pour it on the ground? But for a hundred dollars I could at least buy one T-shirt while I'm inside the goddamn place. So I was like, hell, let's run it. And so they, they they, they brought the funnel out 'cause it was too much titty titty milk to just sip. It was too much to sip. You gotta bring the funnel out. It was like two gallons of titty milk. She was pumping and, And I chucked it all in eight seconds flat. I was doing a great job also. I don't know if y'all love titties as much as I do, but I research 'em breast milk tastes like whatever the mom is eating and drinking. So her titty milk just tasted like ate and tequila with a little bit. It tastes like a redneck Filipino orta. You know what I'm saying? It tastes like a little redneck Filipino orta. But also if y'all, y'all, y'all studied titties so as much as I do, you will know that a titty milk has all the vitamin. I haven't had a hangover in 12 years, nigga. I doing good That my time.

Meanwhile, the bunny is a one man band and all we leave him is nothing but, oh, and by the way, Jesus died and rose from the dead. So have some respect. The, the Pope died yesterday and it's kind of weird because he died the day after JD Vance came to see him. I, I mean it would make a lot more sense if it had been Hillary Clinton, but who had been the last one to see him alive.

'cause diapers leak, y'all. I was a single mom with an only child And I highly don't recommend that to any youngins either. If only I'd had a litter, surely warn 'em.

The rest became y'all's gym teachers. Well, I was looking for love in all the wrong places during the pandemic. I mean the nursing homes. But you know, the competition's pretty stiff there.

So I decide to pull over in the right lane, let him pass me. He pulls up next to me, rolls down his window, and says, ""roll down your window, you trans bitch!"". And I said, ""nope! Ah!"".

I don't know if anyone here likes a finger in their ass. Me, too. Thanks for asking. Um, I feel like a finger in the ass is kind of like having to take summer school to graduate. It's kind of humiliating, but it's the only way I can finish. I'm not good at dirty talk. I realized that recently. I'm not good at dirty talk. My friend told me, she's like, whisper something sexy in her ear. I tried that. Didn't go great. I was like, I'm having a hard time getting a boner right now.  Where's your glitz? Wake up.
